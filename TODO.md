Random notes on todo items

## General

* 

## Server

* Missing undo button when inactive during research
* rolling score option
* BUG: If you click 1 (max) without clicking the drawn card, Inventor's Guild, it does this because I don't have enough money.
* COnfusing DONE to cancel buying a card, i.e. Inventor Guid FIXED



## Client - Both layouts

* Show decoded error on when something cannot be selected/played
  * Noted during play test (PT) also
* Show discounted card cost
  * Update from args ok - TODO initial
* Exchange rate during payment
* Layout types based on size
* Mobile portrait layout
* PT: Missing tooltip on total score
* PT: I selected a corporation and clicked Undo.  It asks me to pick a corporation again, but the card isn't visually shown anymore (Note: its is there but not near the other corp)
* Need to "unstack" show all VP cards during final scoring (it show scoring animation on them)


## Client - Digital layout
* Fix some remaining cards rendering
* Show VP worth on cards
  * VL: Calculated? It would have to from server - can move to server list
* PT: thermometer and scoreboard got out of sync 
  * VL: I think it was related to tracker sincronization and its fixed
* BUG:  Low-quality JPEG for ECOLINE corp tooltip image (any corp really).
  * Removed zoom effect
* Specator section: pink (You are spectator section)
* Incorrectly shows that requirements are not met - the server sent correct info that card is playable (case where requirement adjusted by ability +/- params of corp or other card)

## Client - Cardboard layout

* Add map side area to hold cubes and cards
* Show card discount
